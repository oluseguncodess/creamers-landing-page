# Welcome 👋🏾

I'm currently building a landing page of some ui/ux designers i saw on X! 

##Current Progress. 

I'm currently working on this landing page and i'm primarily focused on the laptop view --- 1440px

This means this landing page isn't responsive yet 🤪. The best view currently is the laptop view provided above. It's the only view that's properly aligned, visually appealing and responsive!

As i make the other views responsive over time, i'll update this readme file 🤓
